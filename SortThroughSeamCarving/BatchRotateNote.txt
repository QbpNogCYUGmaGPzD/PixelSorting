BATCH ROTATE ONLY VERTICAL IMAGES
Jeff Thompson | 2012 | www.jeffreythompson.org

Steps to orient all images the same way!

1.
Go to folder with your images on it
	$ cd [drag folder in for full path]

2.
Rotate! Note: this will overwrite ALL files in it's path...
	$ mogrify -verbose -rotate "90<" *

The "verbose" option shows what's happening - especially nice
for working with lots of image files.
