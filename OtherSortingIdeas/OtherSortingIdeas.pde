OTHER SORTING IDEAS
Jeff Thompson | 2013 | www.jeffreythompson.org

Ideas for pixel-sorting projects:

[ ]  Intentionally bad seam sorting; looks for WORST possible path through an image, sorts by that!

[ ]  Swap color values (r > g, g > b, b > r)

[ ]  Draw a line across screen (must hit top/bottom), sort by that; alternatively, use neighboring
     method to expand like tracing a leaf

[X]  Sort red, green, and blue values separately (re-organizes on a more atomistic level)
